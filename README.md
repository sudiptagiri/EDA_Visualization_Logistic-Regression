# EDA_Visualization_Logistic-Regression
We will get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each other and how the EDA and visualization approach will help us to gain more insights and knowledge about the data that we have and train Logistic Regression using MLE.

Scope:
●	Exploratory data analysis
●	Data Pre-processing and visualization
●	Training logistic regression model with MLE for prediction
●	Tuning the model to improve the performance
